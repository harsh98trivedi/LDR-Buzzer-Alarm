# LDR Alarm

### What is LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)?
A photoresistor is an active component that decreases resistance with respect to receiving luminosity on the component's sensitive surface. The resistance of a photoresistor decreases with increase in incident light intensity; in other words, it exhibits photoconductivity.
